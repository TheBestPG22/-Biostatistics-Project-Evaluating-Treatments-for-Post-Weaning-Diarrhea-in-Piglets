# 🐖 Biostatistics Project: Evaluating Treatments for Post-Weaning Diarrhea in Piglets

## 📋 Overview

This project investigates alternatives to Zinc Oxide (ZnO) for preventing **Post-Weaning Diarrhea (PWD)** in piglets. Due to growing concerns over **antibiotic resistance** and **environmental contamination**, ZnO was banned by the EU in 2022. Our goal is to evaluate different treatments and their effect on piglet growth, measured via **Average Daily Weight Gain (ADWG)**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To compare the effectiveness of 5 treatment strategies (A–E) on piglet growth during three periods:
- `ADWG0021`: Days 0–21 post-weaning
- `ADWG2150`: Days 21–50 post-weaning
- `ADWG0050`: Days 0–50 post-weaning

---

## 🧪 Treatments Compared

| Label | Treatment Description |
|-------|------------------------|
| A     | Normal feed + ZnO (baseline) |
| B     | Normal feed + nutraceuticals |
| C     | Vaccination + high energy/protein in phases 2 and 3 |
| D     | Vaccination + high energy/protein in phases 1–3 |
| E     | Vaccination + high energy/protein in phases 1–3 + nutraceuticals |

## 📊 Dataset Summary

- **Sample Size**: 40 pens (8 pens per treatment, 16 piglets per pen)
- **Observation Level**: Pen-level (not individual piglets)
- **Design**: Balanced across gender and treatments
- **Clean Data**: No missing or negative values

 

## 📦 R Libraries Used

The statistical analysis and visualizations were implemented in R using the following libraries:

- **car** – Hypothesis testing, ANOVA  
- **dunn.test** – Non-parametric post-hoc comparisons  
- **report** – Summary reports of models  
- **multcomp** – Multiple comparisons after ANOVA  
- **dplyr** – Data wrangling  
- **skimr** – Data summarization  
- **ggplot2** – Graphical visualizations

---

### 3. Correlation: ADWG0021 vs ADWG0050 by Sex
Strong positive correlation, indicating early weight gain predicts total gain.

### 4. Statistical Testing Visuals
- Normality & variance tests
- ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis results
- Post-hoc comparisons

## 📊 Statistical Insights

- **Normality**: Shapiro-Wilk test & Q-Q plots suggest data is normally distributed.
- **Homoscedasticity**: Levene and Bartlett tests confirm equal variances.
- **No Significant Gender Difference**: Linear regression and t-tests show no significant difference in ADWG0021 between males and females.
- **Treatment Effect**:
  - Treatment A and E show highest ADWG0021.
  - Treatment B has the lowest.
  - ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis indicate **no significant differences** overall, but pairwise comparison (B vs A) showed a significant result.

---

## 🔍 Linear Regression Summary

- **Model**: `ADWG0021 ~ Sex`
- **Coefficient (Sex=2 vs Sex=1)**: -1.92 (not significant)
- **95% CI**: [-14.32, 10.48]
- **Conclusion**: Gender does not significantly affect early growth.
